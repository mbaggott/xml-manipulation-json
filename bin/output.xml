    <biography>Giovanni Antonio Amadeo was an Italian early Renaissance sculptor, architect, and engineer. In 1466 he was engaged as a sculptor, with his brother Protasio, at the famous Certosa, near Pavia. He was a follower of the style of Bramantino of Milan, and he represents, like him, the Lombard direction of the Renaissance. He practised cutting deeply into marble, arranging draperies in cartaceous folds, and treating surfaces flatly even when he sculptured figures in high relief. Excepting in these technical points he differed from his associates completely, and so far surpassed them that he may be ranked with the great Tuscan artists of his time, which can be said of hardly any other North-Italian sculptor.</biography>

    <biography>Giovanni Bellini was an Italian Renaissance painter, probably the best known of the Bellini family of Venetian painters. His father was Jacopo Bellini, his brother was Gentile Bellini, and his brother-in-law was Andrea Mantegna. He is considered to have revolutionized Venetian painting, moving it towards a more sensuous and colouristic style. Through the use of clear, slow-drying oil paints, Giovanni created deep, rich tints and detailed shadings. His sumptuous coloring and fluent, atmospheric landscapes had a great effect on the Venetian painting school, especially on his pupils Giorgione and Titian.</biography>

    <biography>Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, better known as Sandro Botticelli or Il Botticello The Little Barrel; was an Italian painter of the Florentine school during the Early Renaissance (Quattrocento). Less than a hundred years later, this movement, under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, was characterized by Giorgio Vasari as a golden age, a thought, suitably enough, he expressed at the head of his Vita of Botticelli. His posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century; since then his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting. Among his best known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera.</biography>

    <nationality>Italian</nationality>
    <biography>Vittore Carpaccio was an Italian painter of the Venetian school, who studied under Gentile Bellini. He is best known for a cycle of nine paintings, The Legend of Saint Ursula. His style was somewhat conservative, showing little influence from the Humanist trends that transformed Italian Renaissance painting during his lifetime. He was influenced by the style of Antonello da Messina and Early Netherlandish art. For this reason, and also because so much of his best work remains in Venice, his art has been rather neglected by comparison with other Venetian contemporaries, such as Giovanni Bellini or Giorgione.</biography>

    <biography>Netherlandish painter. He is first documented at Bruges in 1444, and he is thought by some authorities to have been the pupil of Jan van Eyck and to have completed some of the works left unfinished by the master at his death in 1444 (e.g. St Jerome, Detroit Institute of Arts). It is certainly true that he was overwhelmingly influenced by van Eyck, and his copies and variations of his work helped to spread the Eyckian style. </biography>

    <biography>Giovanni Battista Cima, also called Cima da Conegliano was an Italian Renaissance painter, named after the town of his birth, and active mainly in nearby Venice. His paintings are mostly quiet devotional scenes, often in landscape settings, in the manner of Giovanni Bellini. He has been called 'the poor man's Bellini', but because of his calm and weighty figures he was also known in the 18th century (rather incongruously) as 'the Venetian Masaccio'.</biography>

    <biography>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci was an Italian polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, scientist, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist and writer. Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance man, a man whose unquenchable curiosity was equaled only by his powers of invention. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived.</biography>

    <biography>Andrea Mantegna was a North Italian Renaissance painter, a student of Roman archeology, and son in law of Jacopo Bellini. Like other artists of the time, Mantegna experimented with perspective, e.g., by lowering the horizon in order to create a sense of greater monumentality. His flinty, metallic landscapes and somewhat stony figures give evidence of a fundamentally sculptural approach to painting. He also led a workshop that was the leading producer of prints in Venice before 1500.</biography>

    <name>ZOPPO, Marco</name>
    <born-died>b. 1433, Cento, d. 1478, Venezia</born-died>
    <nationality>Italian</nationality>
    <biography>Italian painter of religious subjects. He is first documented in 1455, when he was living in Padua as the adopted son of his teacher Squarcione. However, like Mantegna a few years earlier, Zoppo realized he was being exploited by Squarcione, and later in 1455 he moved to Venice. He spent most of his brief career there and in Bologna (he signed himself Bononensis -- 'Bolognese'). His work includes altarpieces and small devotional pictures, painted in a wiry style reflecting the influence of Mantegna, softened by that of Giovanni Bellini. Two of his paintings are in the National Gallery, London. A substantial number of his drawings survive. </biography>
